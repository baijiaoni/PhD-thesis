In order to reduce the synchronization time, the synchronization process could be started during the acceleration. The phase
difference between two Reference RF Signals of the source and target synchrotrons at the flattop could be predicted by comparison the phases of these two signals at any time during the acceleration. Once the phase difference at the flattop is predicted, the synchronization processw can be carried out. 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Phase shift method
First, the radial loop must be turned off. At some time during the acceleration, the phases difference between the source and target synchrotrons are obtained with the help of the Synchronization Reference Signal, and the phase difference at the flattop is picked up from the look-up table. Then, a rf frequency modulation is superposed on the initial frequency pattern. The integration of the rf frequency modulation equals to the required phase difference. With this new frequency pattern, the phase difference at the flattop will be the required phase difference when the cavity rf frequency of the source and target synchrotrons reach the flattop. 
	\item Frequency method
The radial loop keeps on. At some time during the acceleration, the phases difference between the source and target synchrotrons are obtained with the help of the Synchronization Reference Signal. Then, a frequency detune is superposed on the initial frequency pattern. With this new frequency pattern, the earliest synchronization window will be calculated.
