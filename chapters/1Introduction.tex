\section{Beam transfer systems of the FAIR accelerator}
FAIR, Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research, is a new international accelerator facility. FAIR is aiming at providing high-energy beams with high intensities. Based on the existing GSI accelerators UNILAC and SIS18 serving as injectors, high intensity ion beams over the whole range of stable isotopes will be accelerated in the new heavy ion machine SIS100 to higher energies. The new FAIR accelerator complex with storage rings consists of SIS100, Collector Ring CR, accumulator/decelerator ring RESR and New Experimental Storage Ring NESR. An additional High Energy Storage Ring HESR serves experiments with high energy antiprotons and rare isotope beams.  
For example the \gls{glos:bunch}-to-\gls{glos:bucket} (\gls{B2B}) transfer system for FAIR aims at supporting beam transfers between the following accelerators:
\begin{itemize}
\item The B2B transfer from SIS18 to SIS100
\item The B2B transfer from SIS18 to ESR
\item The B2B transfer from ESR to CRYRING
\item The B2B transfer from SIS100 to CR
\item The bunch to barrier bucket transfer from CR to HESR and later to RESR
\end{itemize}

The B2B transfer system focuses first of all on the transfer from SIS18 to SIS100, but it will be firstly tested for the transfer from SIS18 to ESR and further to CRYRING.
