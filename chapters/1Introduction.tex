%Research leading to the discovery of elementary particles and to ideas for the acceleration of such particles to high energy is dotted with particularly important milestones which from time to time set the directions for further experimental and theoretical research~\cite{wiedemann_particle_2015}. Due to the thirst for knowledge of human beings, the particle accelerator has big progress in the past 100 years. First of all, we look back at the history of the particle accelerator.
%
%In 1927 Rolf Wider$\phi$e developed the first linear accelerator, which maked use of an alternating current (AC) voltage and a series of drift tubes. As the particle gets faster and faster, the drift tubes need to be longer and longer. The linear accelerator needs to be very long for particles to be accelerated to high energies. In 1928, Ernest Lawrence of the University of California, inspired by the work of Wider$\phi$e, had the idea of utilizing a curved path for a particle accelerator. A magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of motion of an accelerated particle makes the particle taking a curved path. By studying the simple relationship between the forces acting on the particle, Lawrence realized that the increase in the radius of the path taken by the particle is compensated by the increased velocity of the particle if the magnetic field, the charge of the particle and the particles mass remain constant. With this in mind, he built what became known as a cyclotron. As the speed of the particle increases, the radius of the semi-circular motion of the particle increases until the particles are eventually focused out of the cyclotron as a high energy beam. The physical principles governing the Betatron were first described by Wider$\phi$e in a paper in 1928 and put into practice in 1940 by Donald Kerst. The development of the Betatron was driven by the demand for high energy X-rays and gamma rays for medical and research usage. The Betatron consists of a main ring, a doughnut shaped vacuum chamber, in which electrons, produced by an electron gun within the chamber, are accelerated. The chamber is set up between the two poles of an electromagnet driven by an AC current, which results in a constantly changing magnetic field. The basic principle of the Synchrotron is to maintain the accelerated particles at a constant orbital radius. This is achieved by synchronizing the magnetic field strength with the energy of the accelerated particles. So, as the particles are accelerated and gain energy, the magnetic field is increased, keeping the particles orbit constant. The first Synchrotron to be built was a modified Betatron and was completed by two English physicists, Frank Goward and D. Barnes ~\cite{_accelerators_????}.

%Mankind has never stopped learning and practice about the particle accelerators. Nowadays, particle accelerators is playing an important role not only in research application (particle physics, nuclear physics, atomic physics, cosmology and astrophysics, chemistry and biology), but also in element analysis, power engineering, medicine for diagnostics and for therapy and industrial processing~\cite{barbalat_applications_1994}.

The RF system provides longitudinal focusing which constrains the particle motion in the longitudinal phase space to a confined region. The confined region is called the RF bucket. The bunch is the collection of particles captured within one RF bucket. The bunch-to-bucket transfer is transferring bunches from a ring accelerator into the center of specified buckets of another ring accelerator.  

The bunch-to-bucket transfer is best described in the picture of James Bond jumping from a truck to catch the fast rope of a helicopter. The truck and the helicopter must move at constant speed (the bunch-to-bucket transfer only when the rf frequencies of two rf systems of the source and target synchrotrons are constant). They should have the same speed. If the truck moves with 80 km/h and the helicopter with 600 km/h, then James Bond won't survive (the bunch-to-bucket transfer when two rf systems have correct frequencies). They must of the right relative position, so that James Bound will catch the fast rope, when he jumps (the phase difference between two rf systems must be correct). Of course the time of James Bond’s jump is of extreme importance (the bunches must be injected into the correct buckets). And now we make it even more exciting, because we would like to do this close to the speed of light.

FAIR, Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research, is a new international accelerator facility under construction at GSI Helmholtz center for Heavy Ion Research GmbH (short: GSI)\footnote{Planckstrasse 1, 64291 Darmstadt, www.gsi.de} ~\cite{eschke_international_2005, _fair_2011}. It is aiming at providing high-energy beams of ions from antiprotons to uranium with high intensities.  Based on the existing GSI \gls{UNILAC} and SIS18 serving as injectors, high intensity ion beams over the whole range of stable isotopes will be accelerated in the new heavy ion machine SIS100 to higher energies. The new FAIR accelerator complex with storage rings consists of SIS100, Collector Ring CR, accumulator/decelerator ring RESR and New Experimental Storage Ring NESR ~\cite{spiller_fair_2006, steck_advanced_2008}. An additional High Energy Storage Ring HESR serves experiments with high energy antiprotons and rare isotope beams. The bunch-to-bucket transfer among FAIR ring accelerators is of great importance to accelerate beam to higher energy and achieve beam operations for experiments.

Nowadays, there are several accelerator institutes in the world, who operate the bunch-to-bucket transfer for specific purposes. 

CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, is one of the world's largest and most respected centres for scientific research.  At CERN, the world’s largest and most complex scientific instruments are used to study the laws of nature. 

The LHC proton beam injection chain achieves the proton beam with the energy of 7Tev. From a source, protons are injected into a linear accelerator, LINAC-2. Protons are accelerated to an energy of 50 MeV (kinetic). Pre-accelerated proton bunches are then injected into the first synchrotron of the chain, namely Proton Synchrotron Booster (PSB). The PSB is composed of four identical rings stacked on the top of one another. This acceleration stage carries the proton bunches up to 1.4 GeV. The protons with an energy of 1.4 Gev are injected into the Proton Synchrotron (PS), which accelerates the protons to the energy of 25Gev. The proton beams are further transferred to the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS), which served as the final injector for high-intensity proton beams for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).

The LHC heavy ion beam injection chain achieves the heavy ion with the energy of 2.76TeV/u. Heavy ions like lead and argon ions are produced by an ECR ion source and sent to LINAC-3 to reach the energy of 4.2
MeV/u, which is required for injection into the Low Energy Ion Ring (LEIR). The LEIR injects ion beam in the PS at the energy of 72.2 MeV/u. The beam is accelerated to the energy of 5.9 GeV/u and than transferred to SPS. SPS accelerated the beam to 177 GeV/u and SPS transfers the beam further to LHC.

J-PARC, Japan Proton Accelerator Complex, is a high-intensity proton accelerator to provide various secondary particles such as neutrinos, neutrons, and mesons for a variety of experiments at T2K, the Material and Life science Facility (MLF), and the Hadron Hall \footnote{https://www.kek.jp/en/Facility/ACCL/J-PARC/}.  The J-PARC accelerator consists of the Linac, the Rapid Cycle Synchrotron (RCS) and the Main Ring (MR). The Linac accelerates negative hydrogen ions (H-) up to 181 MeV to inject to the RCS. The negative ions are converted to protons at the injection point of the RCS by a charge-stripping foil. The RCS accelerates protons up to 3 GeV, then extract them to the Material and Life science Facility (MLF) and the MR. The MR accelerates the protons up to 30 GeV, then extract in one turn to the T2K neutrino target or slowly to the Hadron Hall. 

BNL, Brookhaven National Laboratory, specializes in high energy physics, energy technologies, environmental science, and nanotechnology. High energy physics of BNL studies the nature of the particles that constitute matter and radiation \footnote{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics}. The BNL accelerator complex contains Linac, Booster, Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS) and Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The Booster accepts ions from Electron Beam Ion Source (EBIS) and protons from the LINAC, and accelerates the beam to the minimum AGS energy before injecting it into the AGS for further acceleration and delivery to RHIC ring.

Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory's accelerator complex comprises seven particle accelerators and storage rings \footnote{http://www.fnal.gov/pub/science/particle-accelerators/accelerator-complex.html}. It produces powerful, high-energy neutrino beam and provides proton beams for a broad range of new and existing experiments. Proton beams enter the Fermilab Booster from the Linac, accelerating to an energy of 8 GeV. The Recycler is a kind of staging area for proton beams after they exit the Booster. Once beam enters the Recycler, protons form a more intense beam with the energy of 8 Gev. Than the proton beam enters the Main Injector, which situated directly beneath the Recycler.  The beam is accelerated to the energy of 120 GeV. Some of the proton beam from the Booster will be used to produce pions in a specially designed target system. These pions will then decay into particles called muons. These muons will be injected into Muon Delivery Ring. The Muon Delivery Ring delivers these muons into a muon storage ring for further study.

IMP, Institute of Modern Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, operates the Heavy Ion Research Facility in Lanzhou (HIRFL) is used to conduct fundamental research in nuclear and atomic physics, which consists of the Sector Focusing Cyclotron, the Separated Sector Cyclotron, the Cooler Storage Ring (CSR) and a number of experimental terminals \footnote{http://english.imp.cas.cn/au/bi/201312/t20131231_115141.html}.  consists of main ring (CSRm), an experimental ring (CSRe) and radioactive beam
 line (RIBLL2) to connect the  two  rings.  The  two  existing  cyclotrons  SFC  (K=69)  and  SSC  (K=450)  of  the  HIRFL  will  be  used  as  its  injector  system. The heavy ion beams with the energy range of 8~30  MeV/u  from the HIRFL will be accumulated,  cooled  and  accelerated  to the high energy range  of 100~400  MeV/u  in  the main  ring  (CSRm),  and  then  extracted  fast  to produce   radioactive   ion   beams   (RIB) or highly-char ged   heavy   ions.   The secondary beams (RIB or highly charged heavy ions) can be  accepted and  stored by  the  experimental ring (CSRe) for many internal-target experiments or high precision  spectroscopy with  beam cooling.  On  the  other  hand  the  beams with the energy range of    
100~900MeV/u will also be extracted  from CSRm by using slow extraction or fast extraction for many external-target experiments \footnote{http://www.slac.stanford.edu/econf/C0211115/papers/013.PDF}.  



The \gls{glos:bunch}-to-\gls{glos:bucket} (\gls{B2B}) transfer system for FAIR aims at supporting beam transfers between the following accelerators:
%\footnote{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facility_for_Antiproton_and_Ion_Research}. 
\begin{itemize}
\item The B2B transfer from \gls{SIS18} to \gls{SIS100}
\item The B2B transfer from \gls{SIS100} to \gls{SIS300}
\item The B2B\footnote{B2B system supports Bunch-to-Barrier bucket transfer as well} transfer from SIS18 to \gls{ESR}
\item The B2B transfer from ESR to CRYRING
\item The B2B transfer from SIS100 to \gls{CR}
\item The B2B\footnote{Bunch-to-Barrier bucket} transfer from CR to \gls{HESR} and later to \gls{RESR}
\end{itemize}

The system supports not only the simple transfer between two accelerators, but also various complex beam transfer for FAIR. It is capable to transfer different species beam from one machine cycle to another and parallel transfer beam through FAIR accelerators. It is able to transfer the beam between two synchrotrons via Fragment Separator (\gls{FRS})\footnote{An ion-optical device used to focus and separate products from the collision of relativistic ion beams with thin targets.} or Super-Fragment Separator (Super FRS). The B2B transfer system focuses first of all on the transfer from SIS18 to SIS100, but it will be firstly tested for the transfer from SIS18 to ESR and further to CRYRING.  

The bunches must be transferred from the buckets of an injecting machine into the middle of the buckets in the receiving machine, namely energy match and phase match. The red dots (1, 2, 3) on Fig.~\ref{inj_error} show the trajectory followed by the center of the bunch after injection with a phase error (dot 1: correct momentum but displaced horizontally with respect to the bucket centre). The green dots (a, b, c) correspond to an injection with the correct phase but with an energy deviation~\cite{baudrenghien_low-level_2010}. 
\begin{figure}[!htb]
   \centering   
   \includegraphics*[width=120mm]{inj_error.png}
   \caption{Bunch-to-bucket injection with phase and energy error.}{X-axis: Phase in radian. Y-axis: momentum, energy or frequency deviation
from synchronism. The red dots (1, 2, 3) show the trajectory followed by the bunch center for an injection phase error. The green dots (a, b, c) correspond to an injection energy error ~\cite{baudrenghien_low-level_2010}.}
   \label{inj_error}
\end{figure}

The injection energy or phase error cause dipole oscillation, that the bunch profile does not change but the phase of the center of charge moves back and forth with respect to the stable phase. 

Besides, the RF voltage must also match. Fig.~\ref{voltage_error} shows the capture of a bunch (marked in red) with perfect phase and energy matching. 
\begin{figure}[!htb]
   \centering   
   \includegraphics*[width=80mm]{voltage_error.png}
   \caption{Bunch-to-bucket injection with voltage error.}{Injection of a bunch (dark red) in the exact center of the bucket but with phase space trajectories mismatched to the two dimensional phase-momentum bunch profile. The result is a quadrupole oscillation at twice the synchrotron frequency and, after filamentation, significant emittance increase ~\cite{baudrenghien_low-level_2010}.}
   \label{voltage_error}
\end{figure}

The center of the bunch falls in the middle of the bucket. The bunch has a non-zero length and therefore occupies an area defined by the
phase space trajectories in the injector. But it is not matched to the phase space trajectories in the receiving machine (the voltage is too high). The particles of the bunch will follow these trajectories, resulting in the evolution shown on the figure: after one-quarter synchrotron period, the bunch length has been reduced (projection on the phase axis) and the momentum spread has been increased. We call
this a quadrupole oscillation. It is a modulation of the bunch length (and momentum spread) at twice the synchrotron frequency. After filamentation the bunch emittance will be much increased and this must be avoided ~\cite{baudrenghien_low-level_2010}.

In Chap.2 the basic principles for the B2B transfer are reviewed. First of all, the energy match between the source and target synchrotrons is introduced. Secondly, two RF synchronization methods are discussed from the perspective of beam dynamics in order for the phase match. Once more, the bucket label and the extraction/injection kicker synchronization are discussed. At the end of this chapter, the beam indication for the beam instrumentation is mentioned.

Chap.3 is concerned with the existing FAIR technical basis for the development of the B2B transfer system and the uniqueness of the system. The system is realized based on the FAIR control system and Low-Level RF system, so these two systems are introduced. In addition, the uniqueness of the B2B transfer system for FAIR is discussed before the chapter ends. 

In Chap.4, a brief overview on the basic procedure of the B2B transfer system is presented. The detailed realization of every basic principles mentioned in Chap.2 for B2B transfer system for FAIR is presented. In addition, the B2B transfer system is explained from the data/signal flow point of view.

The application of the B2B transfer system for FAIR accelerators are outlined in Chap.5. The applications are classified into two categories according to the feature of the circumference ratio. For each category, the corresponding FAIR applications are presented. 

Chap.6 presents the realization of the systematic investigation for the system, mainly from the timing point of view. The calculation of the synchronization window is explained and the transfer of the B2B timing messages via the WR network is tested. In addition, for the B2B transfer from SIS18 to SIS100, two synchronization methods are analyzed from the beam dynamics point of view. The SIS18 extraction and SIS100 injection kicker are systematically investigated. Finally, the test setup is introduced and the test result is presented and analyzed.
