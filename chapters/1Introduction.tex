%Research leading to the discovery of elementary particles and to ideas for the acceleration of such particles to high energy is dotted with particularly important milestones which from time to time set the directions for further experimental and theoretical research~\cite{wiedemann_particle_2015}. Due to the thirst for knowledge of human beings, the particle accelerator has big progress in the past 100 years. First of all, we look back at the history of the particle accelerator.
%
%In 1927 Rolf Wider$\phi$e developed the first linear accelerator, which maked use of an alternating current (AC) voltage and a series of drift tubes. As the particle gets faster and faster, the drift tubes need to be longer and longer. The linear accelerator needs to be very long for particles to be accelerated to high energies. In 1928, Ernest Lawrence of the University of California, inspired by the work of Wider$\phi$e, had the idea of utilizing a curved path for a particle accelerator. A magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of motion of an accelerated particle makes the particle taking a curved path. By studying the simple relationship between the forces acting on the particle, Lawrence realized that the increase in the radius of the path taken by the particle is compensated by the increased velocity of the particle if the magnetic field, the charge of the particle and the particles mass remain constant. With this in mind, he built what became known as a cyclotron. As the speed of the particle increases, the radius of the semi-circular motion of the particle increases until the particles are eventually focused out of the cyclotron as a high energy beam. The physical principles governing the Betatron were first described by Wider$\phi$e in a paper in 1928 and put into practice in 1940 by Donald Kerst. The development of the Betatron was driven by the demand for high energy X-rays and gamma rays for medical and research usage. The Betatron consists of a main ring, a doughnut shaped vacuum chamber, in which electrons, produced by an electron gun within the chamber, are accelerated. The chamber is set up between the two poles of an electromagnet driven by an AC current, which results in a constantly changing magnetic field. The basic principle of the Synchrotron is to maintain the accelerated particles at a constant orbital radius. This is achieved by synchronizing the magnetic field strength with the energy of the accelerated particles. So, as the particles are accelerated and gain energy, the magnetic field is increased, keeping the particles orbit constant. The first Synchrotron to be built was a modified Betatron and was completed by two English physicists, Frank Goward and D. Barnes ~\cite{_accelerators_????}.
%
%Mankind has never stopped learning and practice about the particle accelerators. Nowadays, particle accelerators is playing an important role not only in research application (particle physics, nuclear physics, atomic physics, cosmology and astrophysics, chemistry and biology), but also in element analysis, power engineering, medicine for diagnostics and for therapy and industrial processing~\cite{barbalat_applications_1994}.

Beams of high energy particles are useful for both fundamental and applied research in the science, and also in many technical and industrial fields unrelated to fundamental research. It has been estimated that there are approximately 30000 accelerators worldwide. Only about $1\%$ of them are research machines with energies above \SI{1}{GeV} ~\cite{noauthor_particle_2017}.  As we all know, particles are accelerated by electric fields. The radio frequency (rf) system of an accelerator is devoted to generate the electric field in rf cavities around the ring. Particles are accelerated when they pass through rf cavities in the right phase. Every rf cavity has a limited frequency range,  so particles at rest can not be accelerated to several tens of \SI{}{GeV} energy in one ring accelerator.  Hence, the acceleration must be divided into several energy stages: The first energy stage is achieved usually by a linear accelerator followed by a small ring, which is called ``booster`` and the second stage by a large ring, which is usually called ``main ring``.  The maximum energy of a beam is related to the 'magnetic rigidity' of the dipole magnets used in the accelerator, which is the multiplication of the magnetic field and the bending radius of a particle immersed in the magnetic field. At the time of the beam transfer, the magnetic rigidity of the booster must be equal to that of the main ring. Since the bending radius of the main ring is generally larger than that of the booster, the magnetic field in the main ring starts the further acceleration at a lower level. This allows a continuous increasing of the particle energy until the limits of the dipole magnets of the main ring are reached. The usage of the booster and the main ring works faster to reach the required beam energy, because the booster can be filled and accelerated, when the main ring accelerates particles. The faster acceleration has the advantage to reduce the interaction time between the accelerated particles and the residual-gas atoms in the vacuum chamber, achieving a better beam quality~\cite{moller_beam-residual_1999}. Furthermore, the particle beam transfer among different rings is also used for the production of high intensity beam, e.g. the beam is transferred to a storage ring for the beam accumulation and beam compression. Hence, the transfer of beam between rings is of great importance for high energy, high intensity and high quality beams.


%For particles with same energy, the booster with smaller bending radius needs stronger magnetic field compared with the main ring, resulting in the higher power supply of the dipole of the booster to achieve the same energy. Hence, the beam transfer between rings is significant important to achieve high energy beam. Particle beam transfer among rings is also used for the production of the high intensity beam, e.g. the beam is transferred to a storage ring for the beam accumulation and beam compression. What's more, the beam transfer between two rings is also important for the beam quality. Interactions between the accelerated particles and the residual-gas atoms in the vaccume chamber may degrade the beam quality, resulting in a reduction in the lifetime of the particles ~\cite{moller_beam-residual_1999} The shorter the interaction, the better the beam quality. The particle beams can be accelerated at the booster at the same time as the beams in the main ring are transferred to following rings, e.g. storage ring. As long as the main ring is empty, the beams are transferred to the main ring from the booster, accelerated and further transferred to the following rings, reducing the interaction time of the particle in following rings. Hence, the transfer of beam between rings is of great importance for high energy, high intensity and high quality beam.

%Beams of high energy particles are useful for both fundamental and applied research in the sciences, and also in many technical and industrial fields unrelated to fundamental research. It has been estimated that there are approximately 30000 accelerators worldwide. Of these, only about $1\%$ are research machines with energies above \SI{1}{GeV} \footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_accelerator}}.  As we all know, particles are accelerated by the electric field. The rf system is devoted to generate the electric field at rf cavities around the ring. Particles are accelerated when they pass through rf cavities. Every rf cavity has a limited frequency range,  particles at rest can not be accelerated to several tens of \SI{}{GeV} energy in one ring accelerator.  So the acceleration must be divided into several energy stages: the first energy stage is achieved usually by a small ring, which is called ``booster`` and the second stage by a large ring, which is usally called ``main ring``.  The energy of a beam is determined by the 'magnetic rigidity' of the dipole, which is the multiplication of the magnetic field and the bending radius of a particle immersed in the magnetic field. Compared with the main ring, the booster needs higher power supply of the dipole to achieve the same energy. Hence, it is significant to use  the beam transfer to achieve high energy beam. Particle beam transfer among rings is also used for the production of the high intensity beam with some specific technology, e.g. the beam is transferred to a storage ring for the beam accumulation and beam compression. What's more, the beam transfer between two rings is also important for the beam quality.  Interactions  between  the accelerated particles and the residual-gas atoms in the vaccume chamber may degrade the beam quality, resulting in a reduction in the lifetime of the particles \footnote{\url{http://www.chem.elte.hu/foundations/altkem/vakuumtechnika/CERN13.pdf}}. The shorter the interaction, the better the beam quality. The particle beams can be accelerated at the booster at the same time as the beams in the main ring are transferred to some experiments or other rings. Hence, the transfer of particle beam among rings is of great importance.

%The rf system provides longitudinal focusing which constrains the particle motion in the longitudinal phase space to a confined region. The confined region is called the ``rf bucket`` ~\cite{_lhc_????}. The ``bunch`` is the collection of particles captured within one rf bucket  ~\cite{_lhc_????}. The \gls{glos:bunch}-to-\gls{glos:bucket} (\gls{B2B}) transfer is transferring bunches from a source ring accelerator into the center of specified buckets of a target ring accelerator.  
%
%The bunch-to-bucket transfer is best described in the picture of James Bond jumping from a truck to catch the fast rope of a helicopter, see Fig. ~\ref{Helikopter}. The bucket of the source ring accelerator is regared as the truck and James Bond as a bunch within this bucket. The helicopter is seen as a bucket of the target ring accelerator. The truck and the helicopter must move at constant speed (the bunch-to-bucket transfer only when the rf frequencies of the two rf systems of the source and target ring accelerators are constant). They should have the same speed. If the truck moves with \SI{600}{\kilo\meter/\hour} and the helicopter with \SI{600}{\kilo\meter/\hour}, then James Bond won't survive (the bunches and the buckets are with same speed, namely two rf systems have correct frequencies). They must be of the right relative position, so that James Bound will catch the fast rope, when he jumps (the phase difference between the two rf systems must be correct). Of course the time of James Bond’s jump is of extreme importance (the bunches must be injected into the correct buckets).

\end{figure}

The beam transfer is not arbitrary. A \gls{glos:bunch} of particles running in a ring should be transferred into the correct position of another ring. Fig. ~\ref{B2B} illustrates the transfer of a bunch of particles between two rings. The example in Fig. ~\ref{B2B} is with the circumference ratio between the right and left rings of four. Bunches of particles are transferred from the left ring to the right one. The blue ellipse represents a bunch of particles and the red rectangle represents the allowable area for particles to be injected. The red rectangles are equally spaced around the ring and determined by the rf frequency. The white space between two red rectangles is forbidden for particles. The allowable area (red rectangle) for particles is termed as a ``bucket`` and a bunch of particles (blue ellipse) as a ``bunch``. The definition of a bunch and a bucket from the accelerator physics perspective, please see Chap. 2. There are two buckets at the left ring and every bucket keeps a bunch. There are eight buckets in the right ring and two of them are filled with bunches. The left ring is connected to a transfer beamline by a switch, which is called a ``switch 1``. When the switch $1$ is off, bunches circulate around the ring. When it is on, bunches will be guided from the ring to the transfer beamline at a specific position around the ring, which is called the ``extraction point`` (represented as a black short bar on the left ring). The transfer beamline is connected to the right ring by another switch, called a ``switch 2``. When the switch $2$ is on, bunches will be guided from the transfer beamline to the right ring at a specific position around the ring, which is called the ``injection point`` (represented as a black short bar on the right ring). Generally both switches are off. The bunch-to-bucket (B2B) transfer is defined as that bunches of the left ring are transferred to the correct buckets at the right ring. For the B2B transfer, bunches at the left ring and buckets at the right ring must have not only a constant but same velocity. Because the circumference of the right ring is four times longer than that of the left ring, bunches run four cycles of the left ring when buckets run one cycle of the right ring. The distance between two bunches of the left ring is equal to the distance between two continuous buckets of the right ring. Besides, the relative position between bunches and buckets must match. Bunches of the left ring are guided to the transfer beamline and transferred to the right ring. They are guided exactly to two empty buckets of the right ring. Every time when a bunch of the left ring passes by the extraction point, a bucket of the right ring will pass by the injection point after a specific time delay, which equals to the time-of-flight of a bunch in the transfer beamline. What's more, the time for the beam guide in the transfer beamline is of great importance, determining which buckets to be filled. In Fig. ~\ref{B2B}, two empty buckets closely following the filled buckets of the right ring need to be filled (represented as the dotted ellipse). The switch $2$ must be switched on when the first empty bucket following two filled buckets passes the injection point and the switch $1$ must be switched on a specific time earlier, when a bunch passes by the extraction point. 

The ring is called a ``source ring``, from which the beam is extracted. The ring is called a ``target ring``, into which the beam is injected. From the above illustration, several preconditions are compulsory for the B2B transfer. The first precondition is that bunches of the source ring and buckets of the target ring have a constant speed, namely the revolution frequencies of the two rf systems of the source and target rings must be constant and therewith the constant cavity rf frequencies, which are harmonics of the revolution frequencies. Beam feedback loops on the rf system are usually implemented in order keep the stability of the beam. The constant revolution frequency requires that the beam feedback loop must be switched off before the B2B transfer. The second precondition is that bunches and buckets are with a same speed, which requires that the revolution frequency ratio between two rings is equal to the reciprocal of the circumference ratio. When the circumference ratio between two rings is an integer, the phase difference between two revolution frequencies is constant. It means that bunches always pass the extraction position a constant time earlier/later before/after buckets pass the injection position. But the constant phase difference is not correct for the transfer. In order to get the correct phase difference, an azimuthal positioning of bunches in the source ring or buckets in the target ring must be adjusted. This is called  ``phase shift method``. After the phase shift, the phase difference of two revolution frequencies is correct and the correct phase difference stays for an infinite time theoretically. Because beam feedback loops are switched off, the beam is stable only for a short period of time. So the beam must be transferred as soon as possible. %The time frame of two revolution periods is used for the transfer. 
When the circumference ratio is not an integer, the phase difference between two revolution frequencies of particles orbiting in the rings varies periodically. Within one period, there must be one point in time when the phase difference between the two rf systems is correct. Before and after this time point, there exists the mismatch between bunches and buckets. The earlier and later than this time point within a period, the larger the mismatch. Waiting for the phase difference to match is called ''frequency beating method''. For both the phase shift and frequency beating methods, the transfer can only happen when the mismatch is smaller than a tolerable limit, introducing a time frame. The time frame is called the ``synchronization window``, which achieves the ``coarse synchronization`` between the machines.

Bunches are switched from one path to another path by kicker magnets (short: kicker). The extraction kicker kicks bunches out of the source ring to the transfer beamline and the injection kicker kicks them from the transfer beamline into buckets of the target ring. They are located at the extraction position and injection position in Fig. ~\ref{B2B}. When the phase difference between the two rf systems is correct, the extraction kicker could kick bunches out of the source ring at the exact time-of-flight to the transfer beamline before empty buckets pass the injection kicker. With the synchronization window, the extraction and injection kickers must be fired at the correct time in order to transfer bunches into correct empty buckets. The process of the kicker firing at the correct time is termed as the ``fine synchronization``.

%
%A bunch of particles is constrained by rf system and the number of bunch around the ring is determined by rf system. provides longitudinal focusing which constrains the particle motion in the longitudinal phase space to a confined region. The confined region is called the ``rf bucket`` ~\cite{_lhc_????}. The ``bunch`` is the collection of particles captured within one rf bucket  ~\cite{_lhc_????}. The \gls{glos:bunch}-to-\gls{glos:bucket} (\gls{B2B}) transfer is transferring bunches from a source ring accelerator into the center of specified buckets of a target ring accelerator.

\section{Bunch-to-Bucket Transfer worldwide}
Nowadays, there are several accelerator institutes in the world, who operate the B2B transfer among rings for specific purposes. 
\gls{CERN}, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, is one of the world's largest and most respected center for scientific research. The Large Hadron Collider (\gls{LHC}) beam injection chain achieves the proton beam with the energy of \SI{7}{TeV}. After accelerated by a linear accelerator, bunches are injected into buckets of the Proton Synchrotron Booster (\gls{PSB}) and further into the Proton Synchrotron (\gls{PS}), the Super Proton Synchrotron (\gls{SPS}) and LHC ~\cite{ferrand_cern-acc-note-2015-0025_2015}. For the LHC heavy ion beam injection chain with the achievement of the energy of \SI{2.76}{TeV/u}, bunches are first of all injected into the Low Energy Ion Ring (\gls{LEIR}) and the following transfer from PSB to LHC is same as the proton beam chain ~\cite{ferrand_cern-acc-note-2015-0025_2015}. For Japan Proton Accelerator Complex (\gls{J-PARC}), bunches are transferred from the Rapid Cycle Synchrotron (\gls{RCS}) to buckets of the Main Ring (\gls{MR}) ~\cite{noauthor_j-parc_2016}. The Booster of Brookhaven National Laboratory (\gls{BNL}) transfers bunches to buckets of the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (\gls{AGS}) and bunches of AGS are transferred further into the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (\gls{RHIC}) ~\cite{noauthor_brookhaven_2017}. Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (\gls{Fermilab})'s accelerator complex provides high energy proton beams for a broad range of experiments. Proton beams are injected into the Recycler from the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (\gls{Fermilab}) Booster. Then the proton beam enters the Main Injector from the Recycler. The beam is accelerated to the energy of \SI{120}{GeV}. Some of the proton beam from the Booster will be used to produce a beam of special particles for Muon Delivery Ring. The Muon Delivery Ring delivers the beam into a muon storage ring for further study ~\cite{noauthor_fermi_2016}. Institute of Modern Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (\gls{IMP}) operates the Heavy Ion Research Facility (\gls{HIRFL}) in Lanzhou. Two existing cyclotrons, the Sector Focusing Cyclotron (\gls{SFC}) and the Separated Sector Cyclotron (\gls{SSC}), are used as an injector system for the Cooler Storage Ring main ring (\gls{CSRm}) for the accumulation, cooling and acceleration. Then the beam is extracted from CSRm to produce radioactive ion beams or highly-charged heavy ions, which can be transferred to the Cooler Storage Ring experimental ring (\gls{CSRe}) for many experiments ~\cite{noauthor_institute_2013, man_survey_2002}.  

\gls{FAIR}, the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research, is a new international accelerator facility under construction at \gls{GSI} Helmholtz center for Heavy Ion Research GmbH (short: GSI)\footnote{Planckstrasse 1, 64291 Darmstadt, www.gsi.de} ~\cite{eschke_international_2005, noauthor_fair_2011}. It is aiming at providing high-energy beams of ions from antiproton to uranium with high intensities. The new FAIR accelerator complex in its full version will consist of the \gls{SIS100}\footnote{SIS18 stands for SchwerIonen Synchrotron (100 Tm magnetic rigidity).}, the SIS300\footnote{SIS300 stands for SchwerIonen Synchrotron (300 Tm magnetic rigidity).}, the Collector Ring (\gls{CR}) and the Hign Energy Storage Ring (\gls{HESR}) ~\cite{spiller_fair_2006, steck_advanced_2009}. FAIR has so many rings, so the B2B transfer among FAIR ring accelerators is of great importance to accelerate beams to higher energy with high intensity and achieve beams for various experiments. Based on the existing GSI \gls{UNILAC} and \gls{SIS18} serving as injectors, high intensity ion beams over the whole range of stable isotopes will be accelerated in the new heavy ion machine SIS100/\gls{SIS300} to higher energy. The beam from the SIS100 will be transferred to the CR via the antiproton bar (\gls{Pbar}) target \footnote{The antiproton bar is used to produce antiprotons in inelastic collisions of high energy protons with nucleons of a target nucleus.} or the Superconducting Fragment Separator (Super-FRS) \footnote{Super-FRS is used to produce rare isotopes of all elements up to uranium at relativistic energies and spatially separate them within a few hundred nanoseconds.}. The CR has the purpose of stochastic cooling of both secondary rare isotope and antiproton beams and of measuring nuclear masses ~\cite{nolden_collector_2006, bar_technical_2013}. The CR transfers the beam to the HESR for the accumulation. The HESR serves experiments with high energy antiproton and rare isotope beams ~\cite{toelle_hesr_2007}. The proton and heavy ion beams could also be transported from the SIS18 to the existing GSI Experimental Storage Ring (\gls{ESR}) and further to the first FAIR-storage ring CRYRING@ESR (short: CRYRING) for the atomic and nuclear physics experiment ~\cite{lestinsky_cryring_2015, lestinsky_cryring_2012}. The proton and heavy ion beams could also be transferred from SIS18 to ESR via the Fragment Separator (\gls{FRS})\footnote{An ion-optical device used to focus and separate products from the collision of relativistic ion beams with thin targets.}.

For many FAIR accelerator pairs, the circumference ratio between the large and small rings is an integer, e.g. the SIS100 and the SIS18, so the phase difference between two revolution frequencies of rings is constant. The frequency is in the \SI{}{MHz} range. In this scenario, the phase shift method must be used for the match of the phase difference between the two rf systems. When the circumference ratio between FAIR accelerator pairs is not an integer, e.g. the SIS18 and the ESR \footnote{ESR has an injection/extraction orbit, which is \SI{15}{cm} longer than the design orbit. The orbit of ESR in this dissertation means the injection/extraction orbit.}, the phase difference between two revolution frequencies shifts automatically. The frequency of the phase difference variability is in the \SI{}{kHz} range. The synchronization window for the FAIR B2B transfer is in the \SI{}{\micro\second} range. The beams of ion species, from hydrogen to uranium as well as antiproton and rare isotope beams, should be transferred among all rings. And every transfer must be achieved within the upper bound \SI{10}{ms} and the B2B injection mismatch in the range between $-1^\circ$ and $+1^\circ$. Both the phase shift and the frequency beating method should be applicable in the upcoming FAIR facilities. The B2B transfer system is designed to work in a parallel operation, e.g. the transfer from SIS18 to SIS100 and the transfer from ESR to CRYRING can be performed at the same time. It is capable to transfer the beam between two rings via the FRS or the Super FRS. The B2B transfer system must coordinate with the SIS100 emergency dump for all unacceptable failure or situation. 


%\section{First overview of the FAIR bunch-to-bucket transfer system}
%From the example of James Bond, we know several precondition for the B2B transfer. The first precondition is that the bunch of the source ring and the bucket of the target ring have a constant speed, namely the rf frequency of the two rf systems of the source and target ring accelerators must be constant. The second one is that the bunch and bucket are with same speed, which requires that two rf systems must have correct frequencies. 
%
%In order to transfer bunches to buckets, two rf systems must have correct phase difference. The process of achieving the correct phase difference is named as ``synchronization``. There are two methods for the synchronization. The synchronization is achieved by an azimuthal positioning of the bunch in the source synchrotron or the bucket in the target synchrotron. This is so-called ''phase shift method''. When two rf frequencies are slightly different, they are beating, perceived as periodic variations in phase difference, whose rate is the difference between the two frequencies. The synchronization is automatically achieved. This is so-called ''frequency beating method''. The phase shift method provides a theoretically infinite time frame for the B2B transfer and the frequency beating method provides a finite time frame, within which bunches could be transferred into buckets with the bunch-to-bucket center mismatch smaller than the upper bound $\pm1^\circ$. The time frame is called ``synchronization window``, which achieves the ``coarse synchronization``.
%
%The bunch are switched from one path to another path by dipole magnets, which are called ``kicker magnet`` or ``kicker``. The extraction kicker kicks the bunch out of the source ring and the injection kicker kicks the bunch in the target ring. After the synchronization between the two rf systems, the extraction kicker must kick the bunch in the source ring at the exact time-of-flight between two rings before the center of a specific bucket passes the injection kicker. With the synchronization window, the extraction and injection kickers must be fired at the correct time in order to transfer bunches into correct buckets. The process of the kicker firing at the correct time is called ``fine synchronization``.

%
%The LHC proton beam injection chain achieves the proton beam with the energy of \SI{7}{TeV}. From a source, protons are injected into a linear accelerator, LINAC-2. Protons are accelerated to an kinetic energy of \SI{50}{MeV}. Pre-accelerated proton bunches are then injected into the first synchrotron of the chain, namely Proton Synchrotron Booster (PSB). The PSB is composed of four identical rings stacked on the top of one another. This acceleration stage carries the proton bunches up to \SI{1.4}{GeV}. The protons with an energy of 1.4 Gev are injected into the Proton Synchrotron (PS), which accelerates the protons to the energy of \SI{25}{GeV}. The proton beams are further transferred to the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS), which served as the final injector for high-intensity proton beams for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) ~\cite{ferrand_synchronization_2015}.
%
%The LHC heavy ion beam injection chain achieves the heavy ion with the energy of \SI{2.76}{TeV/u}. Heavy ions like lead and argon ions are produced by an ECR ion source \footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_cyclotron_resonance}} and sent to LINAC-3 to reach the energy of \SI{4.2}{MeV/u}, which is required for injection into the Low Energy Ion Ring (LEIR). The LEIR injects ion beam in the PS at the energy of \SI{72.2}{MeV/u}. The beam is accelerated to the energy of \SI{5.9}{GeV/u} and than transferred to SPS. SPS accelerated the beam to \SI{177}{GeV/u} and SPS transfers the beam further to LHC ~\cite{ferrand_synchronization_2015}.
%
%J-PARC, Japan Proton Accelerator Complex, is a high-intensity proton accelerator to provide various secondary particles for a variety of experiments.  The J-PARC accelerator consists of the Linac, the Rapid Cycle Synchrotron (RCS) and the Main Ring (MR). The Linac accelerates negative hydrogen ions up to \SI{181}{MeV} to inject to the RCS. The negative ions are converted to protons at the injection point of the RCS by a charge-stripping foil. The RCS accelerates protons up to \SI{3}{GeV}, then extract them to the Material and Life science Facility (MLF) and the MR. The MR accelerates the protons up to \SI{30}{GeV}, then extract in one turn to a target ~\cite{_j-parc_????}. 
%
%BNL, Brookhaven National Laboratory, specializes in high energy physics, energy technologies, environmental science, and nanotechnology. High energy physics of BNL studies the nature of the particles that constitute matter and radiation . The BNL accelerator complex contains Linac, Booster, Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS) and Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The Booster accepts ions from Electron Beam Ion Source (EBIS) and protons from the LINAC, and accelerates the beam to the minimum AGS energy before injecting it into the AGS for further acceleration and delivery to RHIC ring ~\cite{_brookhaven_????}.
%
%Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory's accelerator complex comprises seven particle accelerators and storage rings. It produces powerful, high-energy neutrino beam and provides proton beams for a broad range of new and existing experiments. Proton beams enter the Fermilab Booster from the Linac, accelerating to an energy of \SI{8}{GeV}. The Recycler is a kind of staging area for proton beams after they exit the Booster. Once beam enters the Recycler, protons form a more intense beam with the energy of \SI{8}{GeV}. Then the proton beam enters the Main Injector, which situated directly beneath the Recycler. The beam is accelerated to the energy of \SI{120}{GeV}. Some of the proton beam from the Booster will be used to produce pions in a specially designed target system. These pions will then decay into particles called muons. These muons will be injected into Muon Delivery Ring. The Muon Delivery Ring delivers these muons into a muon storage ring for further study ~\cite{_fermi_????}.
%
%IMP, Institute of Modern Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, operates the Heavy Ion Research Facility (HIRFL) in Lanzhou. HIRFL is used to conduct fundamental research in nuclear and atomic physics, which consists of the Sector Focusing Cyclotron (SFC), the Separated Sector Cyclotron (SSC), the Cooler Storage Ring (CSR) and a number of experimental terminals. CSR includes a main ring (CSRm), an experimental ring (CSRe) and radioactive beam line to connect the two rings. The two  existing cyclotrons SFC and SSC will be used as its injector system for CSRm, which is able to accumulate, cool and accelerate beam to higher energy. Then the beam is extracted to produce radioactive ion beams or highly-charged heavy ions. The radioactive ion beams or highly-charged heavy ions can be transferred to CSRe for many experiments ~\cite{_institute_????, man_survey_2002}.

The extraction kicker kicks the bunch out of the source ring and the injection kicker kicks the bunch in the target ring. After the synchronization between the two rf systems, the extraction kicker must kick the bunch in the source ring at the exact time-of-flight between two rings before the center of a specific bucket passes the injection kicker. With the synchronization window, the extraction and injection kickers must be fired at the correct time in order to transfer bunches into correct buckets. The process of the kicker firing at the correct time is called ``fine synchronization``.

%%The bunches must be transferred from the buckets of an injecting machine into the middle of the buckets in the receiving machine, namely energy match and phase matching. The red dots (1, 2, 3) on Fig.~\ref{inj_error} show the trajectory followed by the center of the bunch after injection with a phase error (dot 1: correct momentum but displaced horizontally with respect to the bucket centre). The green dots (a, b, c) correspond to an injection with the correct phase but with an energy deviation~\cite{baudrenghien_low-level_2010}.

%The injection energy or phase error cause dipole oscillation, that the bunch profile does not change but the phase of the center of charge moves back and forth with respect to the stable phase.

%Besides, the rf voltage must also match. Fig.~\ref{voltage_error} shows the capture of a bunch (marked in red) with perfect phase and energy matching.

%The center of the bunch falls in the middle of the bucket. The bunch has a non-zero length and therefore occupies an area defined by the
%phase space trajectories in the injector. But it is not matched to the phase space trajectories in the receiving machine (the voltage is too high). The particles of the bunch will follow these trajectories, resulting in the evolution shown on the figure: after one-quarter synchrotron period, the bunch length has been reduced (projection on the phase axis) and the momentum spread has been increased. We call
%this a quadrupole oscillation. It is a modulation of the bunch length (and momentum spread) at twice the synchrotron frequency. After filamentation the bunch emittance will be much increased and this must be avoided ~\cite{baudrenghien_low-level_2010}.

\section{Objectives, Contribution and Structure of the Dissertation}
This dissertation contributes to the development of the FAIR B2B transfer system from the timing perspective. It concentrates on the introduction of the concept of the FAIR B2B transfer system and its application for FAIR accelerators. In addition, it explains the systematic investigation for the FAIR B2B transfer system in details.

The dissertation is structured as follows and as depicted in Fig.~\ref{dissertation_structure}.

In Chap.2, the theoretical background for the B2B transfer is reviewed. First of all, the energy, phase and voltage match between the source and target synchrotrons are introduced. Secondly, two rf synchronization methods are discussed from the perspective of beam dynamics for the phase alignment. At the end of this chapter, the synchronization of the extraction and injection kicker magnets are discussed.

Chap.3 is concerned with the existing FAIR technical basis for the development of the FAIR B2B transfer system and the uniqueness of the system. The B2B transfer system is realized based on the FAIR control system and low-level rf system, so these two systems are introduced. In addition, the comparison between the FAIR B2B transfer system and the current B2B transfer with the GSI control system is discussed before the chapter ends. 

In Chap.4, a brief overview on the basic idea of the B2B transfer system is presented. After that the basic procedure of the FAIR B2B transfer is introduced and the realization of each step of the procedure is explained. In addition, the FAIR B2B transfer system is explained from the data flow perspective.

Chap.5 presents the systematic investigation for the B2B transfer system, mainly focusing on the timing aspect. The calculation of the synchronization window is explained and the transfer of the B2B messages via the white rabbit (WR) network is tested. In addition, for the B2B transfer from the SIS18 to the SIS100, two synchronization methods are analyzed from the perspective of the beam dynamics. The SIS18 extraction and the SIS100 injection kicker are systematically investigated. Finally, the test setup is presented and the result is analyzed.

The application of the FAIR B2B transfer system for FAIR accelerator pairs are outlined in Chap.6. The applications are classified into three categories according to the feature of the circumference ratio. Many FAIR use cases are with an integral circumference ratio, e.g. the SIS18 and the SIS100, there is a constant phase difference between the two rf system. Although the phase shift can be used for the phase matching, the frequency beating method is preferred via the detune of one rf system. Because the phase shift must be executed slowly enough to guarantee the beam quality, which needs much longer time than the frequency beating method. The ratio of the circumference between many pair of machines in FAIR is close to an integer or far away from an integer, e.g. the SIS18 and the ESR, the SIS100 and the CR, the CR and the HESR. the phase matching is achieved by the frequency beating. For each category, the corresponding FAIR use cases are presented.
