The project is kept on Git repository \url{https://github.com/GSI-CS-CO/bel_projects/tree/lm32_B2B_merge}. In the test setup, the frame \verb|CMD_B2B_START| uses the eventID of \textit{0XDEADBEEF11111111} as an example and the frame \verb|TGM_PHASE_TIME| uses the eventID of \textit{0XDEADBEEF22222222} as an example and the frame \verb|TGM_SYNCH_WIN| uses the eventID of \textit{0XDEADBEEF33333333} as an example.
